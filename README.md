![SponsorCX Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67878600-d644-46de-ab92-455a2f04688b)

We're excited that you would like to be part of the team here at SponsorCX and we're excited to talk with you!  

## Introduction
Below, you'll find a repository with a simple React and Node.js application. The project is left open-ended for you to provide your unique solution to the problem. Please spend no more than 4 hours working on the challenge. 

The goal of the challenge is:
- Learn about your work & working style
- Introduce you to problems like the ones we work on at SponsorCX

*Note: If you have a personal project that you believe better showcases your work, you can use that instead. The repo should be public and demonstrate your ability to work from the backend to the frontend.*

## Background

At SponsorCX, we help `organizations` manage the sponsorships they have with their customers (e.g. `accounts`). For this challenge, we'll focus specifically on the `Deals` that an organization has with their various `accounts`.

**Organization**: An `organization` is a company that has signed up to use our platform to manage their sponsorships.

**Account**: An `Account` is a company that an organization has a potential sponsorship with.

**Deal**: A `Deal` is a contract between an `organization` and an `account`. It has a `start date`, an `end date`, a `value`and a `status`.

Organizations can have multiple `accounts` and `accounts` can have multiple `deals`. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## The Challenges - 3.5 hours
SponsorCX organizations need a way to view all of their `deals` and how much they are worth. We have broken this into two challenges. Refer to [Getting Started](#getting-started) for instructions on how to run the application.

#### Challenge 1
- Create the models and endpoints to get all of the `deals` for an organization. The `organization` model is created for you, but you'll need to create the account and deal models.

#### Challenge 2
- Add a page to the react application that displays the `deals` and their total value. Pull the deals data from the api you created in challenge 1.

#### Challenge 3
- Organizations need to be able to filter the `deals` by `status` and `year`. Add this functionality to the api and frontend.
